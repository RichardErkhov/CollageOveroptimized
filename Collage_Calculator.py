IMPORTANT NOTICE: This Code can have pretty heavy usage of the disk on which you store the images. Furthermore,
the access time to get each image plays a crucial role. As such it is suggested to
run this code of an SSD as Random Read performance on them is way better than that of Hard Drives.
It should still be said that even with an SSD the time to process a single collage can be extremely
large, especially if you utilise the advanced compare function.

    As to refer to quality of generated collages. It directly depends on four factors:
1. How many images You have downloaded
2. The resolution of the downloaded images
3. The Horizontal resolution you set for the collage
    Anything posted by me ( u/QentaiX ) on reddit was most likely generated with my library of ~80,000 images
all in resolution of 64x64, sometimes downscaled to 32x32. For similar results you can simulate my workspace 
by downloding similar amount of images in the same resolution. If the output quality still does not satisfy 
your needs, contact me and I might be able to see what I can do to improve it. Thank You!

    For anybody who may be reading this and is relatively new to Python... First of all, thank you!
It is a great achievement for me to have a chance to have my code potentially help somebody. For You,
I would recommend reading the code from top to bottom as processing steps are roughly sorted that way
and understanding every next step might not be as easy without knowing how the previous part works.
    I have made an attempt at explaining everything in a lot of detail focusing on the points that took
longer for myself to figure out. In case any explanations are insufficient, you can text me on reddit
at u/QentaiX. It is also cool if you share any collage created with this code with me and in case the result
does not satisfy you I can try to help as much as I can.
