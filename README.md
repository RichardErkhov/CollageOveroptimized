Step #1

  To create collages with this code the first step is to get a folder with a lot of images in exactly the same resolution ( have to be squares ). I offer a straightfoward path of using the Downloader.py programm to do that for you. If you already have the images, you are free to skip to step #2.

  Now to download the images, first set up your e621 API access and copy the key from there. Type in your credentials in the downloader and make sure to point your output folder somewhere where it won't mess up your device. Then just run the code and wait for it to finish ( This is recommended to be run overnight )
  
Step #2

  Now put in all the required data for your future collage in the Collage_Generator. While running it, you can ignore all the error messages - they are normal, the code won't break ( hopefully ). If for some reason something breaks, contact me on reddit ( u/QentaiX ) and I will help as soon as I can. It should be noted that collages take A WHILE to process. Do not expect it to be immediate.
  
Step #3

Enjoy the Collage!
